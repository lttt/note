    "A reentrant mutual exclusion Lock with the same basic behavior and semantics as the implicit monitor lock accessed using synchronized methods and statements, but with extended capabilities.\n",
    "A ReentrantLock is owned by the thread last successfully locking, but not yet unlocking it. A thread invoking lock will return, successfully acquiring the lock, when the lock is not owned by another thread. The method will return immediately if the current thread already owns the lock. This can be checked using methods isHeldByCurrentThread(), and getHoldCount().\n",
    "\n",
    "The constructor for this class accepts an optional fairness parameter. When set true, under contention, locks favor granting access to the longest-waiting thread. Otherwise this lock does not guarantee any particular access order. Programs using fair locks accessed by many threads may display lower overall throughput (i.e., are slower; often much slower) than those using the default setting, but have smaller variances in times to obtain locks and guarantee lack of starvation. Note however, that fairness of locks does not guarantee fairness of thread scheduling. Thus, one of many threads using a fair lock may obtain it multiple times in succession while other active threads are not progressing and not currently holding the lock. Also note that the untimed tryLock method does not honor the fairness setting. It will succeed if the lock is available even if other threads are waiting.\n",

    "# Lock接口：\n",
    "## public interface Lock\n",
    "     Lock接口，相比于使用synchronized关键字，提供了更多互斥锁的操作。他允许更加灵活的结构，并且可能与隐式锁的使用有很大区别。\n",
    "一个锁对象 为多个线程访问共享资源提供控制，通常，锁提供了互斥的资源访问方式：每次只有一个线程可以持有锁，每个对于共享资源的访问，都需要先持有该锁。然而。某些所允许并发的访问共享资源，如读写锁的读锁。<br/>\n",
    "    同步方法或语句的使用，提供了对与每个对象关联的隐式监视器锁的访问，但是强制所有锁获取和释放，都以块结构的方式进行:当一个代码获取多个锁之后，必须以其获取锁相反的顺序，逐个释放锁，并且所有的锁都要在他们获取锁的同一代码范围内释放。\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of synchronized methods or statements provides access to the implicit monitor lock associated with every object, but forces all lock acquisition and release to occur in a block-structured way: when multiple locks are acquired they must be released in the opposite order, and all locks must be released in the same lexical scope in which they were acquired.\n",
    "\n",
    "虽然同步方法的范围机制，为程序使用管程锁提供了遍历，也有利于避免锁相关的编程错误，但是这种方式在某些场合缺乏灵活性。譬如，有些算法要求遍历并发访问数据结构，要求使用移交锁，或者链锁。Lock接口的实现类可以提供类似功能。\n",
    "While the scoping mechanism for synchronized methods and statements makes it much easier to program with monitor locks, and helps avoid many common programming errors involving locks, there are occasions where you need to work with locks in a more flexible way. For example, some algorithms for traversing concurrently accessed data structures require the use of \"hand-over-hand\" or \"chain locking\": you acquire the lock of node A, then node B, then release A and acquire C, then release B and acquire D and so on. Implementations of the Lock interface enable the use of such techniques by allowing a lock to be acquired and released in different scopes, and allowing multiple locks to be acquired and released in any order.\n",
    "\n",
    "灵活性的提高是有代价的，失去了代码范围的控制，也同时造成了释放锁的操作需要客户端来完成。一般都以以下方式使用锁：\n",
    "With this increased flexibility comes additional responsibility. The absence of block-structured locking removes the automatic release of locks that occurs with synchronized methods and statements. In most cases, the following idiom should be used:\n",
    "\n",
    "     Lock l = ...;\n",
    "     l.lock();\n",
    "     try {\n",
    "         // access the resource protected by this lock\n",
    "     } finally {\n",
    "         l.unlock();\n",
    "     }\n",
    " 当获取锁和释放锁存在于不同的代码范围中时，必须格外注意，加锁与释放锁的代码都必须被执行。所有一般使用 try--finally代码块来实现。\n",
    "When locking and unlocking occur in different scopes, care must be taken to ensure that all code that is executed while the lock is held is protected by try-finally or try-catch to ensure that the lock is released when necessary.\n",
    "锁的实现提供了同步方法以外的其他功能:\n",
    "* 非阻塞获取锁tryLock(\n",
    "* 获取可中断锁lockInterruptibly()\n",
    "* 设置获取锁的超时时间tryLock(long, TimeUnit)\n",
    "Lock implementations provide additional functionality over the use of synchronized methods and statements by providing a non-blocking attempt to acquire a lock (tryLock()), an attempt to acquire the lock that can be interrupted (lockInterruptibly(), and an attempt to acquire the lock that can timeout (tryLock(long, TimeUnit)).\n",
    "\n",
    "锁的实现也可以提供与隐式同步方法不同的行为和语义，如：保证排序，不可重入，死锁检测。如果实现提供了这种专门化的语义，那么实现必须记录这些语义。\n",
    "A Lock class can also provide behavior and semantics that is quite different from that of the implicit monitor lock, such as guaranteed ordering, non-reentrant usage, or deadlock detection. If an implementation provides such specialized semantics then the implementation must document those semantics.\n",
    "锁实例也只是普通对象，也可以在锁实例上同步，但是为了避免歧义，不建议这么做。\n",
    "Note that Lock instances are just normal objects and can themselves be used as the target in a synchronized statement. Acquiring the monitor lock of a Lock instance has no specified relationship with invoking any of the lock() methods of that instance. It is recommended that to avoid confusion you never use Lock instances in this way, except within their own implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Except where noted, passing a null value for any parameter will result in a NullPointerException being thrown.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Memory Synchronization\n",
    "所有锁的实现都器强制进行内存同步，这是由内置管程锁在JLS中规定的。\n",
    "All Lock implementations must enforce the same memory synchronization semantics as provided by the built-in monitor lock, as described in section 17.4 of The Java™ Language Specification:\n",
    "一个成功的加锁操作，与一个成功的加锁动作有同样的内存同步效果。\n",
    "一个成功的释放锁操作，与一个成功的释放锁动作有同样的内存同步效果。\n",
    "A successful lock operation has the same memory synchronization effects as a successful Lock action.\n",
    "A successful unlock operation has the same memory synchronization effects as a successful Unlock action.\n",
    "不成功的加锁和释放锁操作，以及重入的加锁，释放锁操作，不要求同样的内存同步效果。\n",
    "Unsuccessful locking and unlocking operations, and reentrant locking/unlocking operations, do not require any memory synchronization effects.\n",
    "## Implementation Considerations\n",
    "关于实现的思考\n",
    "锁获取的三种方式（中可断，不可中断，超时设置）可能在性能特征，排序保证，以及其他实现方面有所不同。甚至，中断正在获取锁的操作（或其他功能），可能在某些实现内是不支持的。一个实现并不要求实现所有三种获取锁的方式，也不需要必须实现可中断的锁获取方法。一个实现只需要清晰地记录每个锁定方法提供的语义和保证。他必须遵守该接口中定义的中断语义规则，锁的可中断获取，要么全部支持，或者只提供方法入口。\n",
    "The three forms of lock acquisition (interruptible, non-interruptible, and timed) may differ in their performance characteristics, ordering guarantees, or other implementation qualities. Further, the ability to interrupt the ongoing acquisition of a lock may not be available in a given Lock class. Consequently, an implementation is not required to define exactly the same guarantees or semantics for all three forms of lock acquisition, nor is it required to support interruption of an ongoing lock acquisition. An implementation is required to clearly document the semantics and guarantees provided by each of the locking methods. It must also obey the interruption semantics as defined in this interface, to the extent that interruption of lock acquisition is supported: which is either totally, or only on method entry.\n",
    "中断一般意味着取消，并且检查中断常常是不常见的，因此一个锁实现，相对于普通方法，可以偏向一个可中断调用。这适用于即使是在另一个动作发生中断可能会阻塞该线程的情况下，一个实现应该记录这种实现。\n",
    "As interruption generally implies cancellation, and checks for interruption are often infrequent, an implementation can favor responding to an interrupt over normal method return. This is true even if it can be shown that the interrupt occurred after another action may have unblocked the thread. An implementation should document this behavior.\n",

Where a Lock replaces the use of synchronized methods and statements, a Condition replaces the use of the Object monitor methods.\n",
